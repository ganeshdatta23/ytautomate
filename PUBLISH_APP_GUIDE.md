# Alternative: Publish Your OAuth App

Since you can't find the test user option, you can publish the app instead.

## ⚠️ Warning
Publishing makes your app available to anyone, but it's fine for personal use.

## Steps to Publish:

1. **Go to OAuth Consent Screen:**
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=youtube-automation-475701

2. **Look for "Publishing status"**
   - Should say: "Testing"

3. **Click "PUBLISH APP" button**
   - Usually near the top of the page

4. **Confirm**
   - Click "CONFIRM" when asked

5. **Done!**
   - Status changes to "In production"
   - Anyone can now authenticate (but only you have the credentials)

## After Publishing:

Run authentication:
```bash
cd d:\yt-automation\youtube-automation
call venv\Scripts\activate
python authenticate_youtube.py
```

Browser opens → Sign in → Works without test user!

---

## OR: Keep Looking for Test Users

The "Test users" section should be on the OAuth consent screen page. Try:

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=youtube-automation-475701
2. Scroll down the ENTIRE page
3. Look for a section titled "Test users"
4. It might be collapsed or at the very bottom

If you see "Test users: 0", click on that section to expand it.
